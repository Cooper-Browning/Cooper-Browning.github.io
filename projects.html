        Databases Project
        <p id="paragraph">
            In my databases class, my group and I used Microsoft's SQL Server to develop a fully functioning database for a client
            to keep track of tire inventory, clients, cars, customer, revenue, and much more. We designed an ERD and implemented it into
            SQL Server to ensure that the database was efficient and functioning.

        Financial Modeling Project
        <p id="paragraph">
            In my financial modeling class, we used advanced Excel modeling techniques to create a realistic retirement portfolio for a
            client with one daughter. This retirement model allowed the client to use form controls to alter inputs to see how it would
            effect his portfolio at different points in his lifespan. We used Monte Carlo modeling to get a more accurate result for what
            his portfolio may look like at various times.
